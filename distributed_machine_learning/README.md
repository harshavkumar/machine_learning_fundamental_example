# Kubeflow implementation

## Image Classification using Cifar10 Dataset
### Problem Statement
Efficiently build, train, and deploy a high-performance image classification model on a large-scale dataset using Kubernetes and Kubeflow. Optimize the entire machine learning pipeline for performance, cost-effectiveness, and scalability.

#### Requirements:

* Use a publicly available large-scale image dataset (e.g., ImageNet).
* Create a K8s cluster with sufficient resources (CPU, GPU).
* Deploy a Kubeflow pipeline to preprocess images, train a CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
* Optimize the pipeline for performance and cost-efficiency using different hyperparameters and resource allocations.
* Deploy a Kubeflow serving endpoint to expose the trained model for real-time predictions.
* Implement a monitoring system to track model performance and resource utilization.

#### Additional Considerations:

* Explore different CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, Inception) and their impact on performance.
* Experiment with data augmentation techniques to improve model accuracy.
* Consider using distributed training for faster convergence.
* Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting.


## Time Series prediction based on Jeena weather Dataset

#### Problem Statement
 

Effectively build, train, and deploy a time series forecasting model using Kubernetes and Kubeflow to accurately predict future values based on historical data. Optimize the entire machine learning pipeline for performance, accuracy, and scalability.

#### Requirements:

* Choose a time series dataset (e.g., stock prices, weather data).
* Create a K8s cluster with appropriate resources.
* Develop a Kubeflow pipeline to preprocess the data, train a regression model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA), and evaluate its performance.
* Experiment with different feature engineering techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
* Deploy the trained model as a Kubeflow serving endpoint for real-time predictions.
* Implement a monitoring system to track model performance and forecast accuracy.

#### Additional Considerations:

* Explore techniques for handling missing values and outliers in time series data.
* Investigate the use of ensemble methods to improve forecasting accuracy.
* Implement a backtesting framework to evaluate model performance on historical data.
